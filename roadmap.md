- **Blockchain**: ethers.js for Ethereum ecosystem
- **Security**: Helmet.js, express-rate-limit, bcrypt
- **Logging**: Winston with structured logging

### Security Practices
- Implement OAuth 2.0 or JWT for authentication
- Use HTTPS with proper certificates
- Implement proper error handling without information disclosure
- Sanitize all inputs and use parameterized queries
- Implement proper session management
- Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit

### Performance Optimization
- Implement API rate limiting
- Use CDN for static assets
- Optimize database queries with proper indexing
- Implement caching strategies
- Optimize blockchain interaction frequency
- Use connection pooling for database connections

## Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- API response time < 200ms
- 99.9% uptime SLA
- Support for 10,000+ concurrent transactions
- Sub-second blockchain confirmation verification
- 99.99% data accuracy in transaction records

### Business Metrics
- Successful transaction rate > 95%
- Onboarding completion rate > 80%
- Customer support ticket resolution time < 24 hours
- Merchant satisfaction score > 4.5/5
- Time to first payment < 15 minutes

## Risk Mitigation

1. **Blockchain Network Issues**: Implement multiple node fallbacks
2. **Security Vulnerabilities**: Regular security audits and bug bounty program
3. **Regulatory Changes**: Stay updated with crypto regulations and maintain compliance
4. **Scalability Challenges**: Design for horizontal scaling from the start
5. **Market Volatility**: Implement real-time price feeds with caching
6. **Technical Debt**: Regular refactoring and code review processes

This roadmap provides a clear path for building Kyro from the foundation to a fully-featured crypto payment platform. Each phase builds on the previous one, ensuring a stable and secure implementation.
